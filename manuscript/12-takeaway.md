# Takeaway {#takeaway}

In this book, we've taken an organized approach to understanding tmux. As you
use tmux more and more, continue to come back and use this resource to help wrap
your brain around concepts. You do not have to understand the intricacies of the
tmux, let alone the terminal, in a single sitting. Acclimation happens over
time.

tmux' userbase varies in skill level. Some readers of this book may have just
learned how to use the Prefix key yesterday. Others are looking to tweak their
configurations and host it in their dot-config on github. There also exists a
very clever hacker that utilizes the advanced scripting capabilities tmux
offers to pilot the terminal in ways previously thought impossible.

We've covered the server, session, window and pane container concept. Panes are
shells, aka pseudoterminals, aka PTYs. The command system and how configurations
are basically a file filled with commands. An overview of the target system,
which lets you specify objects to interact with tmux commands. An overview of
tmux formats, which allow you to get information on tmux' current state. How to
send keystrokes and copy from tmux panes programmatically. A lot of terminal
tricks that work across platforms and well with tmux, including a file watching
workflow to run linting, testing and build commands on file changes. 2
permissively licensed open source projects demonstration. A tmux session
manager. A tmux configuration you can copy and paste from. A tmux API wrapper
and a tmux session manager.
