# Terminal fundamentals

Before I get into tmux, there are a few fundamentals of the command line I want
to run over. Often, we're so used to using these out of street smarts and muscle
memory, a great deal of us never seen a technical relation of where these tools
stand in relation of one another.

Seasoned developers are familiar with what zsh, bash, iterm2, konsole, /dev/tty,
shell scripting, and so on. If you use tmux, you'll be around these all the time,
regardless of whether you're in a GUI on your local machine or ssh'ing into a remote
server.

I'm not going to go super deep into the technicalities, but if you ever wanted to
dive into how processes and tty's work at the kernel level (data structures and all)
I reccomend the book *The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System
(2nd Edition)* by Marshall Kirk McKusick. In particular, Chapter 4, *Process Management*
and Section 8.6 *Terminal Handling*. [*The TTY demystified*](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/index.php)
by Linus Ã…kesson (available online) dives into the TTY and is a good read as well.

## POSIX roots

Operating systems like MacOS (formerly OS X), Linux and the BSD's all follow
something similar to the POSIX specification in terms of how
they square away various responsibilities and interfaces of the operating
system. They're categorized as ["Mostly POSIX-compliant"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#Mostly_POSIX-compliant).

In daily life, we often use systems that break compatibility with POSIX
standards for sheer reasons of practicality. Operating systems like MacOS will
drop you right into Bash. [`make(1)`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/make.html),
which is also a POSIX standard, is in actuality [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
on MacOS by default.  Did you know that as of September 2016 POSIX Make has no conditionals?

I'm not saying this to take a run at purists, as I'm someone who tries to remain
as compatible as possible in my scripting, it gets very hard to do simple
things after a while. On FreeBSD, the default Make
[(PMake)](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/pmake/) uses dots
between conditionals:

    .IF

    .ENDIF

But on most Linux systems and MacOS, GNU Make is the default so they get to do:

    IF

    ENDIF 

## Terminal interface

The terminal interface can be best introduced by stating their is an official
specification laying out its technical properties, interfaces and
responsibilities in its [POSIX specification](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap11.html)

## Terminal emulation

GUI Terminals: Terminal.app, iterm, iterm2, konsole, lxterm, xfce4-terminal,
rxvt-unicode, xterm, roxterm, gnome terminal, cmd.exe + bash.exe

## Shell interpreters (Shells)

Examples: POSIX sh, Bash, ZSH, csh, tcsh, ksh, fish

When we speak about "shells", such as the examples below, we're often referring
to the interpretter.

On most Linux distributions and MacOS, you'll typically be dropped into Bash.

As of October 2016, the [latest specification](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html)
covers in technical detail the responsibilities of the shell.


## Shell languages

Each shell interpreter has its own language features. Like with shells themselves,
many will resemble the [POSIX shell language](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_01).

You will sometimes see this in `.sh` files, which at their header, 

ZSH and Bash should be able to understand POSIX shell you write.
