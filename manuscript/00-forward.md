## About this book

You do not need a book to use or understand tmux. But if there is a book, let this be the one.

## How this book is structured

First, anything involving installation and hard technical details are in the appendix.

A lot of books tend to use this as filler. For me it's more of not wanting to leave complete beginners behind.

For special circumstances like Windows 10, I opted that going so far as adding screenshots since a fair share may be more comfortable by a visual approach.
